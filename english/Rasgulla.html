<h1>Ingredients of Rasgulla</h1><h2>4 Servings</h2>
<p>2 litre milk
1 1/2 cup sugar
1 teaspoon rose water
3 tablespoon lime juice
3 cup water
1 tablespoon all purpose flour
2 teaspoon powdered green cardamom</p>

<h3>Step 1 Prepare the chhena</h3>
<p>Making Rasgulla is a child's play if you know the right steps 
    and almost everyone can make this delicious mithai. 
    Take a heavy-bottomed pan and add two litres of full-cream milk to it. 
    When it comes to a boil, reduce the flame and add the lemon juice. 
    Your milk may take a while to curdle and you may require to add a little more lemon juice. 
    Once the milk starts curdling, keep the flame low and allow boiling for 2-3 minutes 
    so that the whey and chhena separates.</p>

  <h3>  Step 2 Strain the chhena from whey</h3>
  <p>Switch off the gas. At this point, you can clearly see the green whey 
      and the paneer or chhena which will separate from the water 
      and stand out as small chunks. </p>
      
   <h3> Step 3 Strain the whey</h3>
<p>Allow the hot liquid to cool for 10-15 minutes.
    Now take a muslin cloth or a large strainer and strain away from the whey.
    Wash it in running water to remove the smell of lemon. You can store this whey and 
    use it in soups and stews or curries. It is very nutritious. 
    Many people also like to drink it by adding a little salt or sugar.</p>

  <h3> Step 4 Allow the water to separate </h3>
<p>Tie it in the muslin cloth once the chenna cools a bit,
     squeeze away extra water and allow it to hang for some time. Do not refrigerate or 
     it will make the chhena rubbery. This process may take 3-4 hours.</p>

  <h3> Step 5 Prepare sugar syrup </h3>
   <p> Heat water in a pan. When it comes to a boil,
     add sugar and allow it to simmer on low flame. 
     After 10 minutes, check the syrup by taking a drop of the syrup in a spoon.
     If it is of one string consistency, your syrup is ready. Add the juice of half a lemon.
     This will prevent the syrup from granulating later. Also, add gulab jal and cardamom powder.
     Switch off the gas. </p>

     <h3>Step 6 Knead the chhena</h3>
       <p> Take the chhena from the muslin cloth and keep rubbing portions of it from your hand.
         At this point, you can add the maida. You have to rub it enough so that it
        becomes completely smooth and starts releasing a little oil.
        Once your chhena is smooth enough and much lighter in texture,
        make smooth round balls and keep aside. </p>

        <h3>Step 7 Boil the rasgullas </h3>
        <p> Meanwhile heat the sugar syrup again, till it reaches a boiling point.
             Make sure you make small balls as they will swell up once they absorb the syrup. 
             Add the rasgullas one by one in the syrup ensuring there is enough space in the pan.
              Boil for 5-7 minutes on low flame. Do not stir.</p>

       <h3>Step 8 Cook covered </h3>
       <p> Now cover the pan and allow it to simmer on low flame for 5-7 minutes.
           When you remove the lid, you will be delighted to see that the rasgullas
           have swelled up and are looking beautiful! Switch off the flame and allow it to cool. </p>
           
         <h3>Step 9 Enjoy! </h3>
         <p> The rasgullas can be enjoyed warm or cold.
             You can also relish them topped with fruits or ice cream.

         <h2>    Tips</h2>
<p>      Never refrigerate the chhena or the rasgullas will become rubbery.</p>
     <p>    Always use full-cream milk for making rasgullas.</p>
      <p>    You can skip adding maida. If you keep the flame low, rasgulla will not disintegrate.</p>
    <p>          The colour of rasgulla also depends on the type of milk.</p>
    <p>    Overboiling rasgullas can make them shrivel down.     </p>
